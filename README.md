# Naive Bayes Iris
Applying Naive Bayes classifier on Iris flower dataset

## Naive Bayes
In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models, but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels.

## Iris Flowers
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
